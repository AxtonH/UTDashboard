## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Prepare your repository:
```bash
# Make sure these files exist in your repo root:
- package.json ✓
- requirements.txt ✓
- production_app.py ✓
- app.py ✓
- src/ (React code) ✓
```

### 2. Update package.json:
Add this to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "start": "react-scripts start"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x",
    "npm": "9.x"
  }
}
```

### 3. Test locally:
```bash
# Build React app
npm run build

# Test production server
python production_app.py
```

## 🔒 Environment Variables Setup

### For any platform, you'll need:

```env
# Required
ODOO_URL=https://your-odoo-instance.com
ODOO_DB=your_database_name  
ODOO_USERNAME=your_odoo_username
ODOO_PASSWORD=your_odoo_password
